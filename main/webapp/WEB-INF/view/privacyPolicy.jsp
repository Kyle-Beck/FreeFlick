<a id=5><h2>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2></a>

<i>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services using Google or Github openid, we may have access to certain information about you.</i>
<br><br>
Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using a third-party openid provider (Google or Github). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from the openid provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the openid provider concerned, but may include your name, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.
<br><br>
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party openid provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
<br><br>
<a id=6><h2>6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2></a>

<i>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</i>
<br><br>
If you are accessing our Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in and other countries.
<br><br>
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
<br><br>
<a id=7><h2>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2></a>

<i>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i>
<br><br>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
<br><br>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
<br><br>
<a id=8><h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2></a>

<i>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i>
<br><br>
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
<br><br>

<u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.

<br><br>
<a id=10><h2>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2></a>

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
